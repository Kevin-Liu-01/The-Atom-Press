                  This course prepares students for the AMC 8/10 contest. The
                  course is around AMC 10 level. There will be 4 sections to
                  this class each of which last three weeks. In the first three
                  weeks, we will cover topics in algebra. Through the next three
                  weeks, we will go over counting. The next three weeks will be
                  focused on geometry and we will finish off the last three
                  weeks with number theory. Each class will be 90 minutes long.
                  We plan to use the first 15 minutes correcting homework from
                  the previous week and then we will have a short quiz of 3
                  questions from the previous chapter for the next 15 minutes.
                  For the next hour we wil go over the subject planned for the
                  day the rest of the time. This course is taught by a multiple
                  time AIME qual, and multiple honor roll for AMC 10, and a
                  honor roll in AMC 8. Below attached is the syllabus:

                  This course will start off with the first 3 sessions as
                  tryouts to determine the level for the student. Based on their
                  scores on the tryouts, we will split the students into three
                  groups, with ratings 0-600, 600-1000, and 1000-1300. This
                  course is taught by many qualified chess players with ratings
                  over 1500+. The classes for the 0-600 group will be around 45
                  minutes, th 600-1000 group will meet for 60 minutes, and the
                  1000-1300 group will meet for 90 minutes. Below is the
